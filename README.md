## Background
This project was just a fun and interesting idea to learn Kotlin. Even if you dont need much of it for programming Android applications. Started to love Kotlin :) Not many comments because of the lack of complexity

## Kotlin

This was the first time using Kotlin in my life. Since it's basically Java without the bload it was really simple to get used to. Havn't read any tutorials, books or something like that. Just the offical documentation. 

## Android

Tried some new stuff like CardView, Dialogs and Shortcuts but still pretty new to Android Development

## Language Support

All languages except German and English is automatically generated with [Automatic String Resource Translation link](https://asrt.gluege.boerde.de/)

You can add your language or help me translate :)
